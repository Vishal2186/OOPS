# OOPS
learning and practicing **Object oriented programming** concepts...

## The core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

- Encapsulation : <br>
A mechanism that binds data and the functions that manipulate it. It's similar to data hiding, where data is hidden from other classes.
<br><br>
- Polymorphism : <br>
The ability of a function or operator to have more than one definition. It allows different objects to be treated uniformly, and new derived classes to be added without modifying existing code.
<br><br>
- Abstraction : <br>
A technique that displays only the essential information and excludes unnecessary information. It's an extension of encapsulation that allows you to focus on the most important features of a class.
<br><br>
- Inheritance : <br>
The process by which objects of one class acquire some properties of objects of another class. It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. 
<br><br>
- Composition : <br>
  One of the core concepts of OOP. 
<br><br>
- Other concepts of OOP include: <br>
  ```
  (i)   Association
  (ii)  Aggregation
