# OOPS
learning and practicing **Object oriented programming** concepts... <br>
## what is object oriented programing ? <br>
> As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

**The core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:**

- Class: <br>
A class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. A class is like a blueprint for an object.  
<br>For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc. So here, Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.
<br><br>

- Object: <br>
It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without having to know details of each other’s data or code, it is sufficient to know the type of message accepted and type of response returned by the objects. <br>
For example “Dog” is a real-life Object, which has some characteristics like color, Breed, Bark, Sleep, and Eats.

<br><br>
- Encapsulation : <br>
A mechanism that binds data and the functions that manipulate it. It's similar to data hiding, where data is hidden from other classes.
<br><br>
- Polymorphism : <br>
The ability of a function or operator to have more than one definition. It allows different objects to be treated uniformly, and new derived classes to be added without modifying existing code.
<br><br>
- Abstraction : <br>
A technique that displays only the essential information and excludes unnecessary information. It's an extension of encapsulation that allows you to focus on the most important features of a class.
<br><br>
- Inheritance : <br>
The process by which objects of one class acquire some properties of objects of another class. It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. 
<br><br>
- Composition : <br>
  One of the core concepts of OOP. 
<br><br>
- Other concepts of OOP include: <br>
  ```
  (i)   Association
  (ii)  Aggregation
  ```
